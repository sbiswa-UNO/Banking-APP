# Banking-APP
This is a project based on lab 9 and only uses the Account class of the lab. 
I created a login screen, signup screen, and dashboard screen. Error messages are also a feature.\n
to verify login credentials, username and passwords are saved in a users.txt file that is created when a user first creates an account. user data is saved and retrieved from a user specific txt file that is created when the user account is created.
to change the screen I had to use documentations to learn how to clear the screen layout as it seemd I could not directly replace the current screen layout.
